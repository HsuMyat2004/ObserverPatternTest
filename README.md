Observer Pattern (Chapter-2) without using Observable built in class methods

Observer --> Subject 

-- Follow Design Principle --
Strive for loosely coupled designs between objects that interact.

** Because the subject is the sole 
owner of that data, the observers are 
dependent on the subject to update 
them when the data changes.  This 
leads to a cleaner OO design than 
allowing many objects to control the 
same data. **
